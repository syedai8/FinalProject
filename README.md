Name of Game: Island Rescue 

Back Story: 
Myrina was a hidden island paradise, shielded from the outside world by advanced, nearly invisible glass defense domes, where the wealthiest and most brilliant minds—doctors, engineers, and scientists—lived in futuristic luxury. When a catastrophic tsunami, triggered by a seismic event, shattered the island's seemingly impenetrable barriers, it left the elite residents vulnerable and isolated, their state-of-the-art infrastructure in ruins. As the leader of a specialized rescue team, you are sent to the island to restore order, provide aid, and help rebuild, all while navigating the fractured society of survivors who were once untouchable and now must rely on you to lead and rebuild their shattered illusion of a world.

Victory Condition:
Successfully restore key infrastructure such as schools, hospitals, and power generation facilities AND meet the survivors’ needs for water, food, and shelter and emotional support. If you succeed and get greater than or equal to 1500 points, you win. 

Loss Condition:
Fail to manage insfastructue and survivors' needs leading to a dead island that will need full evacuation of all population. This will indicate your score being less than 1500, meaning you lose. 

How to play: 
Read the back story and tend to Myrina by making the best choices as a leader!
