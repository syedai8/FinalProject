Name of Game: Island Rescue 

Back Story: The Shattered Illusion of Myrina
Myrina was a hidden island paradise, shielded from the outside world by advanced, nearly invisible glass defense domes, where the wealthiest and most brilliant minds—doctors, engineers, and scientists—lived in futuristic luxury. When a catastrophic tsunami, triggered by a seismic event, shattered the island's seemingly impenetrable barriers, it left the elite residents vulnerable and isolated, their state-of-the-art infrastructure in ruins. As the leader of a specialized rescue team, you are sent to the island to restore order, provide aid, and help rebuild, all while navigating the fractured society of survivors who were once untouchable and now must rely on you to lead and rebuild their shattered illusion of a world.
